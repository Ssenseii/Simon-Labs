# DevelopeÃ¹ment: 

## September 17th.

After learning more about responsive deisng, react patterns and performance enhancement for faster reload with SSR.I have decided it's time to rebuild the website from scratch.

- Tailwind CSS for styles: small bundle size and scales easily with ~~adaptive~~ responsive design.
- I won't use Next.JS this time, but once I finish the website and deploy it. I'll rebuild the website to include SSG with some content.
- Better developped react hooks with small JS bundles
- responsive deisng first -> scales to wider screen
- Same style-guide but with better Developement
