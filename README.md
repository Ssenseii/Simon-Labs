# Developement: 

## September 17th.

After learning more about responsive design, react patterns and performance enhancement for faster reload with SSR. I have decided it's time to rebuild the website from scratch.

- Tailwind CSS for styles: small bundle size and scales easily with ~~adaptive~~ responsive design.
- I won't use Next.JS this time, but once I finish the website and deploy it. I'll rebuild the website to include SSG (HUGO or Jekyll) for some static content -> (sub 1ms load time).
- Well developed custom hooks instead of HOC for small JS bundles.
- responsive design first -> scale from movile to wider screens.
- rebuild style-guide with responsive values and typography-aware units.
