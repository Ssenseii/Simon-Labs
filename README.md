# Developement: 

## September 17th.

After learning more about responsive design, react patterns and performance enhancement for faster reload with SSR. I have decided it's time to rebuild the website from scratch.

- Tailwind CSS for styles: small bundle size and scales easily with ~~adaptive~~ responsive design.
- I won't use Next.JS this time, but once I finish the website and deploy it. I'll rebuild the website to include SSG (HUGO or Jekyll) for some static content -> (sub 1ms load time).
- Well developed custom hooks instead of HOC for small JS bundles.
- responsive design first -> scale from movile to wider screens.
- rebuild style-guide with responsive values and typography-aware units.

After testing Tailwind out for a day now. I've come to the conclusion it won't work with the design I had in mind.
It limits the customizability greatly, allowing less creativity with the design.
It's still a great tool for building websites and I will be using it for the blog probably.
But it's not for websites that require "fine tuning the settings"

I'll be going back to my favorite option: SCSS


## Septmeber 22nd.

I finished the asset design for an Edgar Allan poe / H.P lovecraft theme. 
After reworking some details in Illustrator. I managed to figure out that SVG backgrounds really hate brush Paths. BMPs are good but they come with a white BG. JPEGs are too big + theyt have a grain to them.

    Conclusion: PNG wins as my new choice for asset format.

I finished the strucutre and it looks spacious, understandeable.

roboto Slab will remain as the main font.
I tried changing it to regular roboto, but it didn't fit the design. It's quite a discovery how largely the font affects the personality of a website.

No sanity needed. I'll use either Hugo, Jekyll or Astro for the blog.

I need website mockups for the portfolio page.


## September 26th

I practically finished the website. Currently, Fixing some bugs and making the UI load faster, and the UX perform better.
I had some kind of imposter syndrom while building the website and while reading a little more about what a develoepr should be. I have came to the conclusion I'm not skilled enough to be the kind of developer I want.

I'm starting my last year of university in a couple of days. I have decided I will learn javascript to the best of my ability and become the best developer I can be. As of now, I'll work on building the blog site, so I can add any new changes there instead of here.
